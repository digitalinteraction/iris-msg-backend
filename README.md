# SMS Relay Server
The API behind the sms relay platform, responsible for handling the apps data and sending push notifications to donors.

Twilio Integration

Twilio integration is required for verifying organisers.

Register a global SMS phone number with Twilio and then ensure that you have the geographic area enabled in the geo-permissions console (https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/settings/geo-permissions). The geo-permissions enables the phone number to send international SMS messages to specific numbers and prevents abuse (i.e. sending messages to expensive international numbers).
