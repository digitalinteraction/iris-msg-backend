# Contribution Guide

A rough guide for keeping a consistent project style

## Style Guides

### Typescript

All JavaScript must adhere to the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/), it isn't officially endorsed by Ecmascript someone just called it that. This style is set up with [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) so it should be easy to follow.

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Moves cursor to..." not "Moved cursor to...")
* Use the first line (72 letters) as a general description then bullet changes on subsequent lines with an `*`
  * Unless you change something _really_ small
