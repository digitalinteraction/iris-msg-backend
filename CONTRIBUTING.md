# Contribution Guide

A rough guide for keeping a consistent project style

## Style Guides

### Typescript

All JavaScript must adhere to the [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/), it isn't officially endorsed by Ecmascript someone just called it that. This style is set up with [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) so it should be easy to follow.

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Moves cursor to..." not "Moved cursor to...")
* Use the first line (72 letters) as a general description then bullet changes on subsequent lines with an `*`
  * Unless you change something _really_ small
* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  * :star: `:star` when adding new features
  * :art: `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  * :racehorse: `:racehorse:` when improving performance
  * :memo: `:memo:` when writing docs
  * :bug: `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  * :fire: `:fire:` when removing code or files
  * :green_heart: `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
  * :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
  * :lock: `:lock:` when dealing with security
  * :arrow_up: `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies
  * :arrow_down: `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies
